# EduardoDotelPortfolio

A simple static website that showcases the work that I've done throughout my career.

This website is going to constantly be updated throughout my career.

A single page with a vertical layout where users can seamlessly look at the necessary information by scrolling up or down.

Version 1 of the website has been deployed to Heroku but this did not include mobile-responsive design.

Version 2 of the website is currently deployed to Heroku which does include mobile-responsive design. This was accomplished through the use of Bootstrap.
